# Object-Detection
Object detection using SSD
This was simple object detection implementation using the Single Shot Multibox Detecter module created in Pytorch. The pretrained pytorch module of SSD was imported from the below link 
https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch


This module is pretrained on the following classes 
background, aeroplane, bicycle, bird, boat,bottle, bus, car, cat, chair, cow, diningtable,dog, horse, motorbike, person, pottedplant, sheep,sofa,train, tvmonitor.


Our video mainly tests the accuracy for detecting two main classes from the above - horse and person
The module that was created clearly identifies these classes with great accuracy. More information on the SSD and how they were outperformed other object detection algorithms like YOLO and RCNN can be found on the below paper
